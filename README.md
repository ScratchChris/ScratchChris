ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI and iOS development using the excellent tutorials found on Hacking with Swift.  I am balancing learning this with a full time job within the Public Sector and being a parent to two little kids.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shopping list app for iOS that rearranges items automatically when you shop to make it quicker to find the things you need, and also  helps familys with budgeting.
