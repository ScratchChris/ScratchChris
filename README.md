- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI and iOS development using the excellent tutorials found on Hacking with Swift.  I am balancing learning this with a full time job within the Public Sector and being a parent to two little kids.

- 100 Days of SwiftUI Progress : ![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/10)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shopping list app for iOS that rearranges items automatically when you shop to make it quicker to find the things you need, and also  helps families with budgeting.

Challenges Overcome whilst building the app :
- SwiftUI Lists and Forms.
- SwiftUI Navigation (both programatically and via navigation links.)
- Tab Bar creation.
- Basics of Core Data and fetch requests across multiple views.
- Core Data deletion and manipulation.
- Loading mutating data as a view initialises to ensure data is live and valid.
- Data re-ordering based on items purchased before and after.
